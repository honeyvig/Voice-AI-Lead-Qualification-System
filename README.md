# Voice-AI-Lead-Qualification-System
VOICE AI. We want the ability to dial clients via VOICE AI and create a lead into an appointment for a finance manager by qualifying it and building a higher quality lead with more interest and qualification.
=================
Below is a Python code example for implementing a VOICE AI system capable of calling clients, qualifying leads, and scheduling appointments. This example leverages Twilio's Voice API for making calls and OpenAI's GPT-4 for natural language processing to engage with clients intelligently. It is designed to identify qualified leads and generate detailed responses to build interest.
Prerequisites

    Install required libraries:

    pip install twilio openai flask

    Set up a Twilio Account:
        Obtain a Twilio Phone Number.
        Get your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token.

    Set up an OpenAI Account:
        Obtain your OpenAI API Key.

Python Code

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse
from twilio.rest import Client
import openai

# Twilio and OpenAI API keys
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Flask app for handling incoming calls and requests
app = Flask(__name__)

# Initialize Twilio client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Define AI conversation logic
def handle_client_interaction(prompt):
    """Generate AI response using OpenAI's GPT."""
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful AI agent qualifying finance leads."},
                  {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

# Endpoint for making calls
@app.route('/make_call', methods=['POST'])
def make_call():
    data = request.json
    client_phone = data['client_phone']
    lead_name = data.get('lead_name', "Client")

    # Initiate call
    call = twilio_client.calls.create(
        to=client_phone,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        url="http://your_ngrok_or_cloud_url/voice_interaction"
    )
    return jsonify({"message": "Call initiated", "call_sid": call.sid})

# Endpoint for handling voice interaction
@app.route('/voice_interaction', methods=['POST'])
def voice_interaction():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Hello! This is an AI assistant calling on behalf of your finance manager.")
    response.gather(
        action="/process_response",
        input="speech",
        timeout=5
    )
    return str(response)

# Endpoint for processing client responses
@app.route('/process_response', methods=['POST'])
def process_response():
    # Extract speech input from the client
    client_response = request.values.get('SpeechResult', None)

    if not client_response:
        return str(VoiceResponse().say("I didn't catch that. Could you repeat, please?"))

    # Generate AI response using OpenAI
    ai_response = handle_client_interaction(client_response)

    # Reply to client based on AI's suggestion
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say(ai_response)

    # Gather further input
    response.gather(
        action="/process_response",
        input="speech",
        timeout=5
    )
    return str(response)

# Start the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Features

    Calling Clients:
        The /make_call endpoint initiates calls to client phone numbers using Twilio's API.

    Voice Interaction:
        The /voice_interaction endpoint handles the interaction using Twilio's VoiceResponse.
        The AI introduces itself, engages with the client, and asks qualifying questions.

    AI-Powered Responses:
        The OpenAI GPT-4 model generates conversational responses based on client input to qualify the lead and build interest.

    Lead Qualification:
        The conversation is structured to determine the clientâ€™s interest and eligibility for an appointment.

    Dynamic Conversation:
        Based on user input, the AI dynamically generates appropriate responses and ensures a natural flow of conversation.

Deployment and Hosting

    Expose the Flask App:
        Use ngrok or a cloud service like AWS, GCP, or Azure to expose your Flask app to the public internet.

    Set Webhook in Twilio:
        In your Twilio Console, set the Voice webhook URL to:

        http://your_ngrok_or_cloud_url/voice_interaction

    Schedule and Monitor Calls:
        Use the /make_call endpoint to automate outbound calls to clients.

Example Workflow

    AI Introduction:
        "Hello, this is an AI assistant calling on behalf of [Finance Manager]. Can I ask you a few quick questions about your finance needs?"

    Qualifying Questions:
        "Are you currently exploring finance options for a new purchase or a refinance?"
        "Can you share a bit about your credit history or income level?"

    Lead Assessment:
        Based on responses, the AI determines whether the lead qualifies and either schedules a meeting or politely declines.

    Appointment Booking:
        If the lead qualifies, the AI confirms a time for a follow-up with the finance manager.

This code provides a robust foundation for a VOICE AI lead qualification system. Let me know if you need help expanding this functionality!
